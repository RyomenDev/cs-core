@ Encapsulation: - Information hiding

    ^ wrapping up data members and functions.

! fully encapsulated class: All data members are marked private. No other class can access it.

/ why? : information hiding - increase in security
/      : if we want we can make class - "read only"
/      : Code reusability
/      : better for unit testing
