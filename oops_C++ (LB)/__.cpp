/*

^ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects." Objects are instances of classes, which can contain both data and methods (functions) that manipulate that data. OOP is designed to improve the organization and reusability of code by grouping related data and functions together and enabling the creation of more complex structures through inheritance and polymorphism.

! Key Concepts of OOP

*1: Class:
A blueprint for creating objects. A class defines a type of object according to the data it holds (attributes) and the operations (methods) it can perform.

*2: Object:
An instance of a class. It represents a specific implementation of the class's attributes and methods.

*3: Encapsulation:
The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.

*4: Abstraction:
The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.

*5: Inheritance:
A mechanism where one class (child class or subclass) inherits attributes and methods from another class (parent class or superclass). This promotes code reuse.

*6: Polymorphism:
The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance. Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

*7 Constructor:
A special method used to initialize objects. It is called when an object of a class is created.

*8 Method:
A function defined inside a class that describes the behaviors of the objects of that class.

! Why OOP is Used

&1:Modularity:
OOP breaks down the program into smaller, manageable, and self-contained components (objects). Each object can be developed, tested, and debugged independently.

&2:Reusability:
Once a class is written, it can be reused multiple times to create objects. Inheritance also promotes reusability by allowing new classes to be created with the properties of existing classes.

&3:Maintainability:
OOP makes it easier to maintain and modify existing code, as objects can be changed without affecting other parts of the program.

&4:Scalability:
OOP allows for the creation of more complex systems by providing a clear modular structure, which is essential for large-scale software development.

&5: Improved Productivity:
By reusing existing code and encapsulating functionality, developers can save time and reduce the likelihood of errors.
